Kode
===========

## What is Kode?

Kode is a homework management system for programming courses at universities.

## What does it really do?

Kode is a web application that allows university professors to send students
assignments. Later Students can login to system and submit their answers.
These submissions can be of any type. But Kode focus on programming assignments
and their submissions.

## What are kode features?

* Plagiarism detection in submissions
* Batch Grade Submissions
* Notify Students of new assignments
* Ability to assign each class one or more TAs
* And much more...

## I'm Excited! What I need to run Kode?!

You need a PHP/MySQL server to use Kode.
For Plagiarism detection you need [nodejs](http://nodejs.org) be installed on
your server.

## Can I use Kode without Plagiarism extension?

Yes!

## How to install?

This [page](https://github.com/milani/Kode/wiki/Installation-Guide) explains how to install Kode on your server.

There is no build script now. But I plan to add a build script to smooth installation process.
